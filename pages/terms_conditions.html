    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Plopp app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices,
        created by Wunderapps (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad-Supported service.</p><br>
    <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms. It is strongly recommended that you carefully
        read and understand these terms before using the Application. Unauthorized reproduction, modification, or
        distribution of the Application or any part of it is strictly prohibited. Attempts to access the Applicationâ€™s
        source code, translate it into other languages, or create derivative works are also forbidden. All trademarks,
        copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights associated with the Application remain the
        property of the Service Provider.</p><br>
    <p>The Service Provider strives to keep the Application as useful and efficient as possible. However, we reserve the
        right to modify the Application or its services at any time and for any reason. If there are charges for any
        features or services, these will be clearly communicated to you in advance.</p><br>
    <p>The Application processes personal data you provide to us in order to offer the service. It is your responsibility
        to ensure the security of your device and access to the Application. We strongly advise against jailbreaking or
        rooting your device, which involves removing the software restrictions imposed by your device's official
        operating system. This could make your device vulnerable to malware, viruses, and compromise its security,
        possibly causing the Application to malfunction or cease working altogether.</p><br>

    <strong>Leaderboard Functionality</strong><br>
    <p>The Application includes a leaderboard feature, which allows users to select and display their own usernames in a
        public ranking system. By using the leaderboard, you agree that this feature is strictly for users aged 13 and
        above. We do our best to monitor and remove inappropriate content, including profanity and abusive language;
        however, we cannot guarantee that all inappropriate content will be caught immediately. The leaderboard may
        contain user-generated content that is not filtered in real-time, and may occasionally include language or
        behavior that some users find offensive.</p><br>
    <p>If you encounter any instances of inappropriate content, including profanity or bullying, you can report it to us
        at <a href="mailto:wunderappsdev@gmail.com">wunderappsdev@gmail.com</a>. We take such reports seriously and will
        take action to review and, if necessary, remove such content.</p><br>

    <div>
        <p>The Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are links to the
            Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play
                    Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://godotengine.org/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div><br>

    <p>Some functionalities of the Application require an active internet connection, which may be Wi-Fi or provided by
        your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application fails to
        function at full capacity due to lack of internet access, network coverage, or if you have exhausted your data
        allowance.</p><br>
    <p>If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, be aware that your mobile network provider's terms may apply,
        and you could incur charges for data usage. These include, but are not limited to, data roaming charges if you
        use the Application while traveling. You are solely responsible for any such charges, and by using the
        Application, you confirm that you have obtained permission from the bill payer of the device you are using, if
        applicable.</p><br>
    <p>The Service Provider cannot assume responsibility for factors such as your device running out of battery, which
        may prevent you from accessing the Application. You are responsible for ensuring your device remains charged and
        functional.</p><br>
    <p>The Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated and accurate at all times but relies on third-party
        sources for certain information. Therefore, we cannot accept responsibility for any loss, direct or indirect,
        that results from relying entirely on the functionality of the Application.</p><br>
    <p>From time to time, the Service Provider may update the Application. The Application is currently available on
        certain operating systems, and these systems may change, requiring you to update the Application. You agree to
        always accept updates when provided, and the Service Provider reserves the right to terminate the availability of
        the Application without prior notice. Upon termination, you must cease using the Application and delete it from
        your device.</p><br>

    <strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong><br>
    <p>The Service Provider may periodically update these Terms and Conditions. You are advised to review this page
        regularly for any changes. Any changes will be posted on this page and will be effective immediately upon being
        posted.</p><br>

    <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-09-02.</p><br>
