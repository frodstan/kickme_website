                <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    "Kick Me" is designed to be a private and secure tool for you. We want to be crystal clear: our app <strong>does not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information. This includes, but is not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
                    <li>Your location data.</li>
                    <li>Your device's unique identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Any data from other apps on your device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We have no servers to store your data on, and we do not use any third-party analytics or advertising services that would track you.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Information You Provide (Stored Locally)</h2>
                <p>
                    Any data you enter into "Kick Me" is saved exclusively on your device's local storage. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The date and time of kick counting sessions.</li>
                    <li>The duration of each session.</li>
                    <li>The number of kicks recorded in each session.</li>
                    <li>Any notes or preferences you set within the app.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This information is for your eyes only. It allows you to view your kick counting history and use the app's features as intended. Because this data is stored locally, we (the developers) cannot access, view, or recover it for you. If you delete the app or clear the app's data from your device settings, this information will be permanently erased.
                </p>

                <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
                <p>
                    "Kick Me" does not require any special permissions to function. It does not need access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or location. The app only uses your device's internal storage to save your session data locally.
